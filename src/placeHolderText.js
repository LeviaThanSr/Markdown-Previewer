# Hi There, This is a heading!
## This is a sub-heading...
### Check This out :

Heres some code, \`<div>Hello World</div>\`
\`\`\`
// this is multi-line code:
(function repeat() {

    repeat();
}) ();
\`\`\`

This text is **bold**
This one is _italic_.
You can use both of them like **_this!_**
You can ~~cross stuff out~~.

You can also use tables:

Hi | Hello | Hi, again!
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Your content can | be here, and it | can be here....
And here. | Okay. | I think we get it.

And of course there are lists.
- list 1
  - list 2 (Some are bulleted)
     - list 3
        - You get the idea


1. And there are numbererd lists too.
1. Use just 1s if you want!
